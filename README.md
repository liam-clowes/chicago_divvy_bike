### Project Overview

This project aims to uncover insights into the habits of Chicago's Divvy bike-share users during the busiest months of the year — June, July, and August (Q3) — spanning the years 2020 to 2023. Through a comprehensive analysis of the Divvy dataset, the project will identify user trends, provide data-driven recommendations to expand existing Divvy bike-share schemes, and explore the boundaries of data privacy in the context of anonymised geospatial datasets.

### Data Sources

- **Main Source**: the primary dataset used for this analysts is from [Divvy Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) (looking specifically at June, July & August)
- **Additional sources**: 'boundaries_neighborhoods.geojson' from the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Neighborhoods/bbvz-uum9) (used primarily on geospatial visualisations)

### Tools

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualisation.
- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and data modelling.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Datetime**: For handling date and time data.
- **Category Encoders**: For encoding categorical variables.
- **Geopandas**: For working with geospatial data.
- **Folium**: For creating interactive maps.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualisation.
- **Plotly**: For interactive graphing.
- **Geopy**: For geocoding and geographical operations.
- **Google Maps**: For cross-referencing locations and identifying buildings at each station/on each route.
